#It seems like duck typing allows you to call groups of methods within a class instead of calling every single method one by one. 
#May be this is done for efficiency?Â¿

##Description from rubylearning.com: In Ruby, we rely less on the type (or class) of an object and more on its capabilities. 
#Hence, Duck Typing means an object type is defined by what it can do, not by what it is. Duck Typing refers to the tendency 
#	of Ruby to be less concerned with the class of an object and more concerned with what methods can be called on it and what 
	#operations can be performed on it. In Ruby, we would use respond_to? or might simply pass an object to a method and know 
	#that an exception will be raised if it is used inappropriately.
